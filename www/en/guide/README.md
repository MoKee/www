# Introduction

Android is an open source operating system that supports multiple mobile devices and is led by [Google](https://www.google.com/about/) and [Open Handset Alliance](https://www.openhandsetalliance.com) leadership and development. Most of the world's equipment manufacturers are currently producing electronic products such as smartphones and tablets with Android operating systems.

These device manufacturers will conduct secondary development on the basis of the [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/), providing customized systems to enhance product competitiveness and attract consumers. For example, Samsung [TouchWiz](https://baike.baidu.com/item/TouchWiz), Huawei [Emotion UI](https://baike.baidu.com/item/EMUI), Xiaomi [MIUI](https://baike.baidu.com/item/MIUI), OPPO [Color OS](https://baike.baidu.com/item/ColorOS), Hammer [Smartisan OS](https://baike.baidu.com/item/Smartisan%20OS) and so on.

## ROM Introduction

[MoKee ROM](https://download.mokeedev.com/) is based on [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com/). All customizations follow the [Material Design](https://material.io/) language by [Google](https://www.google.com/about/), which is maintained with the native Android interface. Consistently, this customization method reduces the difficulty of version upgrades for slower equipment that is not actively updated. [MoKee ROM](https://download.mokeedev.com/) follows [Google](https://www.google.com/about/) to bring the latest Android system to users early.

The lack of localization features has made many users who love native Android discouraged. [MoKee ROM](https://download.mokeedev.com/) has excellent localization features that have been favored by a large number of users, allowing native Android has been getting better since then!

Compared to equipment manufacturers' bloated custom systems, [MoKee ROM](https://download.mokeedev.com/) is simple and pure, with outstanding performance, making it easier for you to use your device.
